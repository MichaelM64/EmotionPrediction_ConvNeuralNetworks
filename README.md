# Emotion Recognition with CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)

In this project, I present a showcase of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to demonstrate a deep understanding and knowledge of these models. The primary objective is to leverage MobileNet for processing large quantities of images and predicting the emotion displayed in each image.

## Model Optimization

The project extensively involves both automatic and manual hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance. The utilization of MobileNet allows efficient handling of image data for emotion prediction.

## Result Analysis

Emotions are classified into the following classes for result analysis:
- 1 = Happiness
- 3 = Surprise
- 4 = Fear
- 6 = Anger

## Possible Enhancements

An intriguing aspect of the project is the visual similarity between surprise and fear emotions, as they share common facial features like open eyes and mouth. Even for a human observer, distinguishing between these two emotions can be challenging when reviewing the training data.

This scenario serves as a real-world example highlighting the importance of not solely relying on labeled and classified data. The reliability of such data can be limited, especially when dealing with emotions that share visual characteristics.

The project aims not only to showcase CNNs in emotion recognition but also to address challenges and considerations in real-world scenarios, emphasizing the need for a nuanced approach to data reliability.
